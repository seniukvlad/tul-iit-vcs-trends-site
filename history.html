<h2>Timeline (high level)</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>RCS (Revision Control System)</strong> — one of the earliest file-based tools for tracking revisions (1970s–1980s).</li>
<li><strong>CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</strong> — introduced repository-level coordination and concurrent edits, widely used in the 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong> — designed as an improved centralized successor to CVS with atomic commits and better metadata (2000s).</li>
<li><strong>Distributed VCS: Git, Mercurial</strong> — early 2000s; Git (2005) rapidly became dominant for speed, branching model, and offline workflows. Mercurial offered a similar distributed approach with different UX choices.</li>
</ol>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Key innovations over time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Centralized repositories with controlled check-ins (CVS, SVN).</li>
<li>Distributed repositories with local history, cheap branching, and fast merging (Git, Mercurial).</li>
<li>Improved metadata, atomic operations, and integrity checks (SHA-based content addressing in Git).</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Short takeaway</h2>
<p>The historical path moved from local file revision (RCS), to centralized server coordination (CVS/SVN), to distributed systems (Git/Mercurial) that empowered faster, more flexible workflows and collaboration.</p>
