<h2>Hosting platforms</h2>
<p>Git hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) provide remote repositories, access control, issue tracking, and integrated CI/CD. They transformed VCS from a developer tool into a collaboration platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized web UI for code browsing and code review.</li>
<li>Integrated CI/CD pipelines and package registries.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section class="feature">
<h2>Workflows — Pull Requests and code review</h2>
<p>Pull requests (or merge requests) are the dominant model: developers open a PR, automated checks run, and reviewers discuss and approve changes. This workflow combines social code review with automation.</p>
</section>


<section class="feature">
<h2>Automation & integration</h2>
<p>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, linters, dependency scanning, and bots run on commits or PRs. Automation reduces manual toil and catches issues early.</p>
</section>


<section class="feature">
<h2>Branching & merging models</h2>
<p>Distributed VCS made branching cheap and merging powerful. Common branch strategies include feature branches, trunk-based development, and Git Flow. The choice influences release cadence and code stability.</p>
<ol>
<li>Feature branches — isolate changes until ready to merge.</li>
<li>Trunk-based development — small frequent merges to mainline.</li>
<li>Git Flow — structured release / hotfix branches (less common for fast-moving teams).</li>
</ol>
</section>


<section class="feature">
<h2>Social coding and community</h2>
<p>Public repositories, forks, issue discussions, and contributor workflows turned many projects into social ecosystems. Open-source collaboration and corporate engineering both rely on these social primitives.</p>
</section>


<section class="feature">
<h2>Short takeaway</h2>
<p>Modern VCS usage combines distributed systems (Git/Mercurial), platform services (hosting, CI/CD), social workflows (PRs), and automation to enable rapid, reliable software delivery.</p>
